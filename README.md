# midi2fmf
MIDI to FMF file converter in Python

This is based on a script by Dragon Shark#0001

# Usage
You can call this script through CLI:
```console
python midi2fmf.py Futurama_Theme
```
Futurama_Theme.mid -> Futurama_Theme.fmf

If you already have a .fmf with the same name, it is overwritten. This way, if you want to adjust downpitch, it's easier.
